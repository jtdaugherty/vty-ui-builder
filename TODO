vBox/hBox

  * Support child spacing controls (applies to all generated boxes
    within any vBox / hBox)

    <vBox spacing="5">

Add support for:

  * List

    - User needs to specify internal value and widget types for the
      list (annoying)

    - Specifying initial list contents could get ugly, since we can't
      necessarily type-check the values resulting from the child
      elements of a <list>.

  * Table
  * Radio buttons
  * Limits
  * Fixed
  * Group

- make it impossible to reference focus group entry names which are
  not in the interface corresponding to a focus group (unless they are
  refs in 'common', in which case that is okay!)

- figure out how to resolve whitespace handling in fText and attr
  elements so it is clear what the semantics will be

- figure out why DTD validation isn't catching some of the attribute
  mistakes I've seen (#REQUIRED attributes are missing and the
  validator does not complain).  HaXml bug?

  Yep, HaXml bug.  Patch submitted.  Turns out multiple attribute
  lists weren't being merged as per the spec, and only the last one
  declared took precedence.  And the last one declared has no required
  attributes, since it's the auto-generated one (all #IMPLIED).
  Whoops!

- support setting render context information: skin, default attributes

- improve error reporting and reduce number of pathological error
  cases by performing up-front validation and by using more types (too
  many 'error' calls)

- Use Posn values in error reporting

- Use exceptions instead of 'error' in error reporting, handle
  exceptions in higher-level routines

- Add support for customizing:
  - the name of the collection builder function
  - name of the interface elements data type

- Do validation on names ([a-z0-9']+) in mkName

- Set an XML namespace in the XML files and require it in the parser.
  Think about how other users of the tool will need to deal with their
  own namespaces.  Also look at best practices for using DTDs as part
  of this change.

- Expose more of the internals of the source generator (VTY imports,
  etc.) which are hard-coded but potentially useful to users

- Make vty-ui-builder able to tell the user which version of vty-ui it
  generates code for (look at cabal file?)

- Add support for typical entity references like &gt;, &lt;, and
  &nbsp; in any text string in the input document

- Add validation test for duplicate interface names

- Trailing newlines in fTexts don't appear to be working.

- Support modular interface files (including other files, etc.)
